					<p>The Thomas Deacon Academy opened in 2007 and was one of the first Academies to be created. We are the largest, single, sponsored Academy in the country offering a personalised learning environment for students from the ages of 7 to 18 years old.</p>
					<p>Our modern facilities, new Junior College and 43 acre campus allow us to provide the ultimate in educational choice. Peterborough is now the fastest growing city in the country and there is fierce competition for places at our Academy.</p>
					<p>Our flexible but disciplined approach to learning, our active engagement in promoting healthy lifestyles and our dedication to developing the whole person, within and beyond the classroom is the key to our success.</p>
					<p>Our specialism is the STEM subjects – Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths – but we are also passionate about music and the arts, about sport and about developing young people to take their place in a complex world.</p>
					<p>Our fully enclosed, gated campus helps keep students safe throughout the day and our Academy Code of Conduct is central to our disciplined approach to the behaviour of all of our students and staff within our Academy and outside in the wider community.</p>
